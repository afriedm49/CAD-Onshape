## Skateboard
The Skateboard is designed on Onshape by combining a deck, trucks, wheels, and bearings. It is then assembled all together.

### Deck

#### Description
The Deck is designed by a rectangle and circles, and is extruded. Holes are poked in the deck symmetrically for screws; it was then named, assigned the material Hard Maple, and colored blue.

#### Reflection
* The instructions for the deck taught me to use the hole tool, which can be used to easily cut holes with different settings of diameter on each part of the hole. It simplifies doing a remove extrude, and the hole can be placed overtop a single point.
* I learned the usefulness of the rectangle shape to outline spaces for other features. This was useful in designing where the screw holes would be, so that the corners of the rectangle mark a symmetrical spot for holes to be placed.
* A helpful hotkey for creating a new sketch is Shift+S.

### Trucks

#### Description
The Trucks are made from 3 different parts combined: The baseplate, the hanger, and the bushing. The baseplate is a flat structure with holes and extensions that connects directly to the deck, and lends support to the axle. It has a pin sticking out of it which the bushing and the hanger are connected to. 
The Hanger is the main axle which the wheels go onto.
The Bushing is a polyurethane ring to provide a shock support and bend to the board.
The Truck hanger and baseplate are made of stainless steel.

#### Reflection
* I learned how to add extrusions from different parts from the original sketch. If trying to create an added extrusion onto another, it is sometimes helpful to extrude from a separate part, and then change the scope so that it adds to the correct part. This can be useful in order to use similar geometry from one part to the next.
* The assembly was difficult, because of weird sketch problems, so I learned the importance of checking each step carefully before continuing, and to make sure everything is constrained before completing the sketch.

### Wheels_and_Bearings

#### Description
The wheels and bearings were both created by first designing a section view sketch, and using a revolve feature to make it circular. The bearing is extruded as a separate part from the wheel.

#### Reflection
* This one was pretty simple, because of how easy the revolve tool is to use. Instead of extruding in one direction, the tool helps to make a rotated surface.
* The bearing was created using the geometry of the wheel, and was created as an extrusion (New) from the inside of the wheel. It was simple in that way, because I did not have to create any new sketch.

### Assembly

#### Description
The assembly consisted of using mate connectors to put all the different parts together. Most connections were via fastened mates, besides the one between the axle and the bearings. Combined, 8 bearings were imported, 4 wheels, 2 trucks, 1 deck, 8 small screws, 8 small nuts, as well as 4 other nuts for the wheels and 2 for the king pin of the trucks.

#### Reflection
* At first, it was difficult to figure out the mate connectors again. The revolve connector allows rotation of the wheels like a real board, so it made sense to use it there, and the rest were fastened mates, allowing no movement.
* The k hotkey was helpful to clear the view (it hides all mate connectors).
